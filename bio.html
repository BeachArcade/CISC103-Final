                        <hr>
                        <p>Hey my name is Ethan Chan, and I used to be a computer science student. Before I came to Delaware, I went to university in Ireland, but that didn't really work out, so I took advice from 'Wayne's World' and moved went to Delaware. Party on Wayne! I can definitively say that people at UD party harder for St Paddy's day than the Irish. On a different note, I am quite like computer science, although, it doesn't quite like me much. Folks have commented on my effortlessly verbose style of writing, it's a skill I practiced in highschool so that I could hit the minimum word count without needing to add more content. Although it may be a bit unconventional, I'm treating this paragraph as the literary equivalent to a filibuster, but with more substance than a block of 'Lorem ipsum'. Moreover, most of the information I'm writing here is irrelevant at worst, and entertaining at best. At this point, I'm certain it's become evidently clear, that english was never really my strong suit, and to that end, neither was computer science. As a kid growing up, I never really liked sports, however, despite this I enjoy watching and supporting Philadelphia sports teams and the Kilmacud Crokes. Crokes a bú! October 1st was the equivalent of the birds losing the Super Bowl back in 2023, the Na Fianna had a definitive, albeit controversial victory over the lads in purple. They'll win this year though, up the dubs and big up the Crokes! At the risk of sounding narcissistic, I've developed an adequate understanding of computing and programming principles. Self aggrandizing aside, on paper I reckon I'm utterly unemployable, and that's probably true.</p>
                        <p>A little more about me, I'm from Philadelphia, I have 2 dogs, and I like dinosaurs. My favorite's the T-Rex, I know it's everyone's favorite, but it's everyone's favorite for a reason. I enjoy watching bush league sitcoms from over a decade ago, 30Rock, Arrested Development, Community, Scrubs, and M*A*S*H are some of my favorites. An unpopular opinion I have is that I don't think The Office or Friends are particularly good, Parks and Rec does have a special place in my heart however.</p>

                            <li>"Ethan Chan has a sort of "dark" aura around him that I would call both intimidating and enticing. His mastery of artificial intelligence manipulation is second to none, and I fear his collusion with chatGPT may lead him down a dark path" - Michael Shanahan</li>
                            <li>"Ethan Chan was by far the worst person I've ever had the displeasure of working with.
