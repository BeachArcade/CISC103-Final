        <p>The Tijuana Rat War began in the late 1870s in the city of Tijuana Mexico and last for over 10 years. Prior to the start of the war, many of the residents feared for the safety of their homes and businesses due to an influx of rodents. Despite the name the Tijuana Rat was not limited to only rats, many other rodents such as mice, prairie dogs, racoons and armadillos were forcibly exterminated from the city. Although the rats were the most widely exterminated, armadillos posed the largest threat, they caused over 84% of all wagon accidents, and 12% of all house fires. Residents of the city lead by vaquero hero Rodrigo de Gordo, took to the streets and cleared the city of these pests. This event draws many parallels to the Alberta Rat War that occured in Canada in 1954, however unlike the Alberta Rat war this is a completely fictional event and there are probably still rodents in Tijuana.</p>

        <p>On this website, I would like to explain the story behind the Tijuana Rat War, and highlight the social, economic, and cultural toll this took on the city. Furthermore I would like to show statistics on late 19th century rodent related accidents and crimes. I think that more people should know about this.</p>

        <p>The panel to the left of here is kind of ugly but I needed to make a repeating image as a background. Furthermore the video in the panel below is not mine. I also figured the color would look nice</p>
